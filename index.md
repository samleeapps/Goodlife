### I'm being bullied. What should I do?
Being bullied is not OK. You should reach out to a trusted adult if you haven't already. This can be a teacher, your mom or dad, other family members or, if you to to a club, a club leader. **Keep in mind**: bullying can be online, at school and indirect. It can also be someone leaving you out of a game multiple times. **Remember**:
