<h3 id="bullying">I&#39;m being bullied. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Being bullied is not OK. You should reach out to a trusted adult if you haven&#39;t already. This can be a teacher, your mom or dad, other family members or, if you to to a club, a club leader. <strong>Keep in mind</strong>: bullying can be online, at school and indirect. It can also be someone leaving you out of a game multiple times.
